This tutorial will introduce you to some fundamental concepts regarding deep learning on graphs via Graph Neural Networks. Don't worry if you don't yet understand some GNN specific concepts such as `GCNConv` -- we will cover this and more, starting with Module 2: Introduction to Graph Neural Networks :).\n",

This graph describes a social network of 34 members of a karate club where a link exists between members if they have interacted outside the club.

Well, python is an untyped programming language and objects are not always the same type you expect. As `dataset` is an object of type ` torch_geometric.data.Dataset` containing the property `num_features`, `args` is a dictionary and unlike other programming languages, such as Javascript, accessing the keys with `.` doesn't work, unless you wrap it in a class end expose the keys as properties dynamically.\n",
